    <p class="context-line">
      Rising geopolitical tensions and the breakdown of the Australasia Accord followed disputes over maritime borders and trade.
    </p>

    <p class="context-line">
      New border protocols kept Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel deployed across the region for extended periods of time.</p>
    <p class="context-line">
      Families were left navigating long-term emotional strain in isolation.
    </p>

    <p class="context-line">
      To retain force readiness and reduce domestic fallout, the Australian Defence Force partnered with a defence tech firm to develop Bezzie.</p>
      <p class="context-line">
      It was designed to provide support, monitor resilience, and keep households steady during prolonged absences.
    </p>

    <p class="context-line">
      To further incentivise participation and engagement with the system, caregiving tasks are tracked and converted into Relational Time Credits (RTC).</p>
    <p class="context-line">These credits are redeemable for leave, mental health services, and cost-of-living relief.
    </p>

    <p class="context-line">
      For partners of defence personnel like Naomi, Bezzie was a reminder she didnâ€™t have to wait alone.</p>
