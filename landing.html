   <h2>About Bezzie</h2>
   </div>
  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
   At Bezzie, our mission is to keep households connected, supported, and resilient – no matter the distance. <br> We believe emotional stability is the foundation of readiness, and we design technology that strengthens bonds while adapting to each family’s unique needs.
  </p>
  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
  Bezzie began as a joint initiative between the Australian Defence Force and human–machine interaction specialists to address the challenges of long-term deployments.
  Early trials demonstrated Bezzie’s ability to maintain morale, reduce emotional strain, and help families stay steady during extended absences.
  <br>Following these successes, Bezzie was adapted for broader use in defence-connected households, offering personalised support, monitoring wellbeing, and fostering national cohesion. Today, Bezzie continues to evolve, bringing the same commitment to care, connection, and resilience that defined its creation.
